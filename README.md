# Surfs Up!

## Challenge Overview

    The pusrpose of this challenge is to help our good friend W. Avy decide if Ouahu, Hawaii will be the best place to open his dream business - a surf and ice cream shop! To help our friend, the power of squlite was used to retrieve data and build summaries using queries. Specifically, we built tables showing weather patterns for the months of June and December. 

## Results
As we can see in the tables, there are a few key differences in between the months of June and December in Ouahu.

    * The highest temperature in June is 85, while in December it is 83
    * The lowest temperature in June is 64, while in December it is 56
    * June's mean temperature is 3 degrees higher than December's
    * December's standard deviation is slightly higher then June's,  showing there is slightly more variance

## Analysis

Based on these findings, it is safe to tell W. Avay that Ouahu is an excellent choce in setting up shop! Although there is some variation between the months of June and December, the months do not vary from eachother as they may do in other locations - essentially surfers can enjoy their sport and ice cream in June and December experiences relatively similar weather! This is substantial as one would expect June and December to vary greatly, as June is the beginning of summer and December winter (or switched - for our friends in the souther hemisphere.) W. Avy is happy to hear this news.
